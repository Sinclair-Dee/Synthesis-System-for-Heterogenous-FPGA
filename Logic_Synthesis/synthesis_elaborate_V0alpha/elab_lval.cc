/*
* These methods generate a NetAssign_ object for the l-value of the
* assignment. This is common code for the = and <= statements.
*
* What gets generated depends on the structure of the l-value. If the
* l-value is a simple name (i.e., foo <= <value>) the the NetAssign_
* is created the width of the foo reg and connected to all the
* bits.
*
* If there is a part select (i.e., foo[3:1] <= <value>) the NetAssign_
* is made only as wide as it needs to be (3 bits in this example) and
* connected to the correct bits of foo. A constant bit select is a
* special case of the part select.
*
* If the bit-select is non-constant (i.e., foo[<expr>] = <value>) the
* NetAssign_ is made wide enough to connect to all the bits of foo,
* then the mux expression is elaborated and attached to the
* NetAssign_ node as a b_mux value. The target must interpret the
* presence of a bmux value as taking a single bit and assigning it to
* the bit selected by the bmux expression.
*
* If the l-value expression is non-trivial, but can be fully
* evaluated at compile time (meaning any bit selects are constant)
* then elaboration will make a single NetAssign_ that connects to a
* synthetic reg that in turn connects to all the proper pins of the
* l-value.
*
* This last case can turn up in statements like: {a, b[1]} = c;
* rather then create a NetAssign_ for each item in the concatenation,
* elaboration makes a single NetAssign_ and connects it up properly.
