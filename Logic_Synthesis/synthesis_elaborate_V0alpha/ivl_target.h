/*
 * This header file describes the API for the loadable target
 * module. The main program can load these modules and access the
 * functions within the loaded module to implement the backend
 * behavior.
 *
 * The interface is divided into two parts: the entry points within
 * the core that are called by the module, and the entry points in
 * the module that are called by the core. It is the latter that
 * causes the module to be invoked in the first place, but most of the
 * interesting information about the design is accessed through the
 * various access functions that the modules calls into the core.
 */


/*
 * In order to grab onto data in the design, the core passes cookies
 * to the various functions of the module. These cookies can in turn
 * be passed to access functions in the core to get more detailed
 * information.
 *
 * The following typedefs list the various cookies that may be passed
 * around.
 *
 * ivl_design_t
 *    This object represents the entire elaborated design. Various
 *    global properties and methods are available from this.
 *
 * ivl_event_t
 *    This object represents an event node. An event node stands for
 *    named events written explicitly in the Verilog, and net events
 *    that are implicit when @ statements are used.
 *
 * ivl_expr_t
 *    This object represents a node of an expression. If the
 *    expression has sub-expressions, they can be accessed from
 *    various method described below. The ivl_expr_type method in
 *    particular gets the type of the node in the form of an
 *    ivl_expr_type_t enumeration value.
 *
 *    Objects of this type represent expressions in
 *    processes. Structural expressions are instead treated as logic
 *    gates.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_t
 *    This object is the base class for all the various LPM type
 *    device nodes. This object carries a few base properties
 *    (including a type) including a handle to the specific type.
 *
 * ivl_net_logic_t
 *    This object represents various built in logic devices. In fact,
 *    this includes just about every directional device that has a
 *    single output, including logic gates and nmos, pmos and cmos
 *    devices. There is also the occasional Icarus Verilog creation.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_t
 *    Structural links within an elaborated design are connected
 *    together at each bit. The connection point is a nexus, so pins
 *    of devices refer to an ivl_nexus_t. Furthermore, from a nexus
 *    there are backward references to all the device pins that point
 *    to it.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_t
 *    Scopes have zero or more parameter objects that represent
 *    parameters that the source defined. The parameter has a value
 *    that is fully elaborated, with defparams and other parameter
 *    overrides taken care of.
 *
 * ivl_process_t
 *    A Verilog process is represented by one of these. A process may
 *    be an "initial" or an "always" process. These come from initial
 *    or always statements from the Verilog source.
 *
 * ivl_scope_t
 *    Elaborated scopes within a design are represented by this
 *    type. Objects of this type also act as containers for scoped
 *    objects such as signals.
 *
 * ivl_statement_t
 *    Statements within processes are represented by one of these. The
 *    ivl_process_t object holds one of these, but a statement may in
 *    turn contain other statements.
 *
 * -- A Note About Bit Sets --
 * Some objects hold a value as an array of bits. In these cases there
 * is some method that retrieves the width of the value and another
 * that returns a "char*". The latter is a pointer to the least
 * significant bit value. Bit values are represented by the characters
 * '0', '1', 'x' and 'z'. Strengths are stored elsewhere.
 *
 * -- A Note About Names --
 * The names of objects are complete, hierarchical names. That is,
 * they include the instance name of the module that contains them.
 *
 * basenames are the name of the object without the containing
 * scope. These names are unique within a scope, but not necessarily
 * throughout the design.

 * When handed a design (ivl_design_t) there are a few things that you

 * entire program. Use the design methods to iterate over the elements
 * of the design.
 *
 * ivl_design_flag
 *    This function returns the string value of a named flag. Flags
 *    come from the "-fkey=value" options to the iverilog command and
 *    are stored in a map for this function. Given the key, this
 *    function returns the value.
 *
 *    The special key "-o" is the argument to the -o flag of the
 *    command line (or the default if the -o flag is not used) and is
 *    generally how the target learns the name of the output file.
 *
 * ivl_design_process
 *    This function scans the processes (threads) in the design. It
 *    calls the user supplied function on each of the processes until
 *    one of the functors returns non-0 or all the processes are
 *    scanned. This function will return 0, or the non-zero value that
 *    was returned from the last scanned process.
 *
 * ivl_design_root
 *    A design has a root named scope that is an instance of the top
 *    level module in the design. This is a hook for naming the
 *    design, or for starting the scope scan.
 *

 *    This method returns true (!= 0) if the expression node

 *    type, which can affect how some of the other expression methods
 *    operate on the node
 *
 * ivl_expr_value
 *    Get the data type of the expression node. This uses the variable
 *    type enum to express the type of the expression node.
 *
 * ivl_expr_width
 *    This method returns the bit width of the expression at this
 *    node. It can be applied to any expression node, and returns the
 *    *output* width of the expression node.
 *
 * ivl_expr_parameter
 *    This function returns the ivl_parameter_t object that represents
 *    this object, or 0 (nil) if it is not a parameter value. This

 *
 * ivl_logic_scope

 *    a string. If the key is not defined, then return 0 (null).
 *
 * ivl_logic_attr_cnt
 * ivl_logic_attr_val
 *    These support iterating over logic attributes. The _cnt method
 *    returns the number of attributes attached to the gate, and the
 *    ivl_logic_attr_val returns the value of the attribute.

/* LPM
 * These functions support access to the properties of LPM
 * devices. LPM devices are a variety of devices that handle more
 * complex structural semantics.
 *
 * These are the functions that apply to all LPM devices:
 *
 * ivl_lpm_name (Obsolete)
 * ivl_lpm_basename
 *    Return the name of the device. The name is the name of the
 *    device with the scope part, and the basename is without the scope.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_scope
 *    LPM devices exist within a scope. Return the scope that contains
 *    this device.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_type
 *    Return the ivl_lpm_type_t of the specific LPM device.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_width
 *    Return the width of the LPM device. What this means depends on
 *    the LPM type, but it generally has to do with the width of the
 *    output data path.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_attr_cnt
 * ivl_lpm_attr_val
 *    These functions access attributes attached to LPM devices. These
 *    attributes may be explicit attributes collected from the Verilog
 *    source, or implicit attributes generated by the compiler.
 *
 * These functions apply to a subset of the LPM devices, or may have
 * varying meaning depending on the device:
 *
 * ivl_lpm_data
 *    Return the input data nexus for device types that have a single
 *    input vector. This is also used to the get nexa of the first
 *    vector for devices that have more inputs.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_datab
 *    Return the input data nexus for device types that have a second
 *    input vector. For example, arithmetic devices are like this.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_decode
 *    Return the DECODER associated with this LPM_FF device. The
 *    decoder for a FF takes an input address and generates an enable
 *    input for no more then 1 bit (can be none) of the FF device.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_q
 *    Return the output data nexus for device types that have a single
 *    output vector. This is most devices, it turns out.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_selects
 *    This is the size of the select input for a LPM_MUX or LPM_DECODE
 *    device, or the address bus width of an LPM_RAM.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_signed
 *    Arithmetic LPM devices may be signed or unsigned if there is a
 *    distinction.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_size
 *    In addition to a width, some devices have a size. The size is
 *    often the number of inputs per out, i.e., the number of inputs
 *    per bit for a MUX.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES:
 *
 * - IVL_LPM_FF
 * The IVL_LPM_FF and IVL_LPM_DECODE devices are closely related. If
 * the ivl_lpm_decode function returns a non-nil value, then the
 * decoder represents an extra ENABLE-like input, where exactly <N>
 * bits of the width of the FF is enabled. The ivl_lpm_width of the
 * decoder defines <N>.
 *
 * The decoder inputs are the address that selects the FF to be
 * enabled, and the ivl_lpm_selects for the decoder gives the width of
 * the address. The address of the LSB of the memory, then, is the
 * word width times the input address. For a simple l-value bit
 * select, the word width <N> will be 1, and the address goes directly
 * to the bit. Otherwise, <N>*address gets to the first bit of the word.
 *
 * The core compiler generates these attributes in certain cases:
 *
 *  - ivl:clock_polarity
 *    If present, the string value can be "INVERT". That indicates
 *    that the clock is negedge sensitive instead of the default
 *    posedge sensitive.
 *
 * - IVL_LPM_RAM
 * The IVL_LPM_RAM may also appear as a READ port for a FF array. In
 * this case, the IVL_LPM_RAM device has an ivl_lpm_width that is the
 * width of the word, and an ivl_lpm_size that is the number of words
 * in the array. In effect, the IVL_LPM_RAM reorganizes a vector into
 * an array of words. If this is happening, then the ivl_lpm_memory
 * will return 0.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_q function gets the output nexa of the read port. The
 * "q" port has as many bits as the width. The ivl_lpm_data2 function
 * gets the nexa of the input, with the sdx the word address and the
 * idx the bit within the word.
 *
 * - IVL_LPM_DEMUX
 * This device is a form of bit replacement. The device has a data bus
 * width (ivl_lpm_width) and an address width. The Data outputs are
 * ivl_lpm_q and have the data bus width. The ivl_lpm_data functions are
 * inputs to the device. Normally, the device passes the data inputs
 * through to the Q output.
 *
 * The IVL_LPM_DEMUX also has a size (ivl_lpm_size) which is the
 * number of addressable units in the device. If the device is bit-
 * addressable, then the size is the same as the width. I.e. if
 * ivl_lpm_width == ivl_lpm_size, then the address selects a single
 * bit. If ivl_lpm_width/ivl_lpm_size == 8, then the address selects
 * words of 8 bits and there are ivl_lpm_size of them. The
 * ivl_lpm_width will always be an exact multiple of
 * ivl_lpm_size. This is slightly different from the meaning of width
 * in memory ports, but reflects that the DEMUX manipulates fixed
 * width ranges within a single vector.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_select inputs address a bit of the device. The
 * addressed bit is substituted by the replacement bit. This
 * replacement bit comes from the ivl_lpm_datab(net,0) nexus.

/* LVAL
 * The l-values of assignments are concatenation of ivl_lval_t
 * objects. Each lvi_lval_t object is an assignment to a var or a
 * memory, through a bit select, part select or word select.
 *
 * Var lvals are things like assignments to a part select or a bit
 * select. Assignment to the whole variable is a special case of a
 * part select, as is a bit select with a constant expression. The
 * ivl_lval_pins statement returns the width of the part select for
 * the lval. The ivl_lval_pin function returns the nexus to the N-th
 * bit of the part select. The compiler takes care of positioning the
 * part select so that ivl_lval_pin(net, 0) is the proper bit in the
 * signal.
 *
 * ivl_lval_mux
 *    If the l-value includes a bit select expression, this method
 *    returns an ivl_expr_t that represents that
 *    expression.  Otherwise, it returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_lval_mem
 *    If the l-value is a memory, this method returns an
 *    ivl_memory_t that represents that memory. Otherwise, it
 *    returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_lval_sig
 *    If the l-value is a variable, this method returns the signal
 *    object that is the target of the assign.
 *
 * ivl_lval_var
 *    If the l-value is a non-signal variable (i.e. a real) this
 *    method returns the ivl_variable_t object that represents it.
 *    If the lval is this sort of variable, then the part_off, idx and
 *    pin methods do not apply.
 *
 * ivl_lval_part_off
 *    The part select of the signal is based here. This is the
 *    canonical index of bit-0 of the part select.
 *
 * ivl_lval_idx
 *    If the l-value is a memory, this method returns an
 *    ivl_expr_t that represents the index expression.  Otherwise, it
 *    returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_lval_pin

/* NEXUS
 * connections of signals and nodes is handled by single-bit

 * manage the ivl_nexus_ptr_t objects that are closely related to the
 * nexus.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_name
 *    Each nexus is given a name, typically derived from the signals
 *    connected to it, but completely made up if need be. The name of
 *    every nexus is unique.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptrs
 *    This function returns the number of pointers that are held by
 *    the nexus. It should always return at least 1. The pointer
 *    proper is accessed by index.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr
 *    Return a nexus pointer given the nexus and an index.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_set_private
 * ivl_nexus_get_private
 *    The target module often needs to associate data with a nexus for
 *    later use when the nexus is encountered associated with a
 *    device. These methods allow the code generator to store to or
 *    retrieve from a nexus a void* of private data. This pointer is
 *    guaranteed to be 0 before the target module is invoked.
 *
 * Once an ivl_nexus_ptr_t is selected by the ivl_nexus_ptr method,
 * the properties of the pointer can be accessed by the following
 * methods:
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_pin
 *    This returns the pin number of the device where this nexus
 *    points. It is the bit within the signal or logic device that is
 *    connected to the nexus.
 *
 *    If the target is an LPM device, then this value is zero, and it
 *    is up to the application to find the pin that refers to this
 *    nexus. The problem is that LPM devices do not have a pinout per
 *    se, the pins all have specific names.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_con
 *    If this is a pointer to a magic constant device, then this
 *    returns the net_const object.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_drive0
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_drive1
 *    These are the 0 and 1 strength values for the devices. For most
 *    devices, these values are fixed by the description in the
 *    original source, with the default as IVL_DR_STRONG. For pins
 *    that are input only, drive0 and drive1 are both IVL_DR_HiZ.
 *
 *    The strength of strength-aware devices (such as nmos devices)
 *    does not really matter, as long at the output is not
 *    IVL_DR_HiZ. Testing for HiZ drivers is how code generators
 *    detect inputs.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_log
 *    If the target object is an ivl_net_logic_t, this method returns
 *    the object. Otherwise, this method returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_lpm
 *    If the target object is an ivl_lpm_t, this method returns the
 *    object. Otherwise, this method returns 0.
 *

 * Scopes of various sort have these properties. Use these methods to

 *
 * - module instances (IVL_SCT_MODULE)
 *    A module instance scope may contain events, logic gates, lpm
 *    nodes, signals, and possibly children. The children are further
 *    instances, or function/task scopes. Module instances do *not*
 *    contain a definition.
 *
 * - function scopes (IVL_SCT_FUNCTION)
 *    These scopes represent functions. A function may not be a root,
 *    so it is contained within a module instance scope. A function is
 *    required to have a definition (in the form of a statement) and a
 *    signal (IVL_SIG_REG) that is its return value.
 *
 *    A single function scope is created each time the module with the
 *    definition is instantiated.
 *
 *
 * - task scopes (IVL_SCT_TASK)
 *    [...]
 *
 * ivl_scope_attr_cnt
 * ivl_scope_attr_val
 *    A scope may have attributes attached to it. These functions
 *    allow the target to access the attributes values.
 *
 * ivl_scope_children
 *    A scope may in turn contain other scopes. This method iterates
 *    through all the child scopes of a given scope. If the function
 *    returns any value other then 0, the iteration stops and the
 *    method returns that value. Otherwise, iteration continues until
 *    the children run out.
 *
 *    If the scope has no children, this method will return 0 and
 *    otherwise do nothing.
 *
 * ivl_scope_def
 *    Task definition scopes carry a task definition, in the form of
 *    a statement. This method accesses that definition.
 *
 * ivl_scope_event
 * ivl_scope_events
 *    Scopes have 0 or more event objects in them.
 *
 * ivl_scope_var
 * ivl_scope_vars
 *    Scopes have 0 or more variable objects in them.
 *
 * ivl_scope_log
 * ivl_scope_logs

 *    represented by ivl_logic_t.
 *
 * ivl_scope_lpm
 * ivl_scope_lpms
 *    Scopes have 0 or more LPM devices in them. These functions access
 *    those devices.
 *
 * ivl_scope_name
 * ivl_scope_basename
 *    Every scope has a hierarchical name. This name is also a prefix
 *    of all the names of objects contained within the scope. The
 *    ivl_scope_basename is the name of the scope without the included

 *
 * ivl_scope_param

 *    A scope has zero or more named parameters. These parameters have
 *    a name and an expression value.

 *    If this is a non-root scope, then the parent is the scope that
 *    contains this scope. Otherwise, the parent is nil.
 *
 * ivl_scope_port
 * ivl_scope_ports
 *    Scopes that are functions or tasks have ports defined by
 *    signals. These methods access the ports by name.
 *
 *    If this scope represents a function, then the ports list
 *    includes the return value, as port 0. The remaining ports are
 *    the input ports in order.
 *
 * ivl_scope_sig
 * ivl_scope_sigs
 *    Scopes have 0 or more signals in them. These signals are
 *    anything that can become and ivl_signal_t, include synthetic
 *    signals generated by the compiler.
 *
 * ivl_scope_time_units
 *    Scopes have their own intrinsic time units, typically from the
 *    timescale compiler directive. This method returns the units as a
 *    signed power of 10 value.
 *
 * ivl_scope_type
 * ivl_scope_tname
 *    Scopes have a type and a type name. For example, if a scope is
 *    an instance of module foo, its type is IVL_SCT_MODULE and its
 *    type name is "foo". This is different from the instance name
 *    returned by ivl_scope_name above.

/* SIGNALS
 * Signals are named things in the Verilog source, like wires and
 * regs, and also named things that are created as temporaries during
 * certain elaboration or optimization steps. A signal may also be a
 * port of a module or task.
 *
 * Signals have a name (obviously) and types. A signal may also be
 * signed or unsigned.
 *
 * ivl_signal_pins
 * ivl_signal_pin
 *    The ivl_signal_pin function returns the nexus connected to the
 *    signal. If the signal is a vector, the idx can be a non-zero
 *    value, and the result is the nexus for the specified bit.
 *
 * ivl_signal_msb
 * ivl_signal_lsb
 *    These functions return the left and right indices, respectively,
 *    of the signal. If the signal is a scalar, both return 0. However,
 *    it doesn't mean that the signal is a scalar if both return 0, one
 *    can have a vector with 0 as both indices.
 *
 * ivl_signal_port
 *    If the signal is a port to a module, this function returns the
 *    port direction. If the signal is not a port, it returns
 *    IVL_SIP_NONE.
 *
 * ivl_signal_signed
 *    A signal, which is a vector, may be signed. In Verilog 2000, any
 *    net or variable may be signed. This function returns true if the
 *    signal is signed.
 *
 * ivl_signal_local
 *    A signal that was generated by the compiler as a place holder is
 *    marked as local.
 *
 * ivl_signal_type
 *    Return the type of the signal, i.e., reg, wire, tri0, etc.
 *
 * ivl_signal_name (DEPRECATED)
 *    This function returns the fully scoped hierarchical name for the
 *    signal. The name refers to the entire vector that is the signal.
 *
 *    NOTE: This function is deprecated. The hierarchical name is too
 *    vague a construct when escaped names can have . characters in
 *    them. Do no use this function in new code, it will disappear.
 *
 * ivl_signal_basename
 *    This function returns the name of the signal, without the scope
 *    information. This is the tail of the signal name. Since Verilog
 *    has an escape syntax, this name can contain any ASCII
 *    characters, except NULL or white space. The leading \ and
 *    trailing ' ' of escaped names in Verilog source are not part of
 *    the name, so not included here.
 *
 * ivl_signal_attr
 *    Icarus Verilog supports attaching attributes to signals, with
 *    the attribute value (a string) associated with a key. This
 *    function returns the attribute value for the given key. If the
 *    key does not exist, the function returns 0.
